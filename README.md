# Doctormate SaaS — Smart OPD Platform (Phase 1)

Doctormate is a multi-tenant cloud-native Smart Outpatient Department (OPD) platform designed to eliminate waiting-room congestion, streamline receptionist phone booking, and give patients real-time arrival intelligence.

---

## 🌟 Phase 1 Objectives & Release Scope

The first release succeeds when:
1. **A hospital can register itself** through an intuitive self-service portal.
2. **Doctors can customize their consultation slot durations** during registration (e.g. 5 minutes for rapid pediatric/follow-up OPD, 10 or 15 minutes for general consultations, 20 to 30 minutes for complex specialties).
3. **A receptionist can book appointments by telephone** in under 15 seconds with duplicate prevention and instant token generation (`DM-<HOSP>-<DATE>-<TIME>`).
4. **The patient can securely track their live appointment queue** through Doctormate using a two-factor verification barrier (Token + Mobile) with real-time arrival buffer guidance.
5. **Multi-tenant data isolation** ensures complete segregation of queues, doctors, branches, and appointments between hospitals.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Technology Stack

| Layer | Technologies & Design Patterns |
|---|---|
| **Frontend** | React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons, Motion |
| **Color System** | White, Teal, Mint, and Slate with high-contrast status accents |
| **Backend API** | Node.js, Express, TypeScript (`tsx`) |
| **Queue Engine** | Rolling Train-ETA model with buffer absorption and real-time delay propagation |
| **Current Database** | SQLite (`better-sqlite3`) in Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) mode |
| **Production Target Database** | PostgreSQL (schema-compatible, standard SQL data types) |

## ⏱️ Doctor Customizable Time Slots

During hospital registration and doctor onboarding, doctors define their appointment cadence:
- **Available intervals**: `5`, `10`, `15`, `20`, `30` minutes.
- The `schedulingService` automatically calculates slot steps and capacity based on the doctor's specific slot length:
  ```ts
  const slotDuration = schedule.slotDurationMinutes || doctor.slotDurationMinutes || 15;
  ```
- **Live Train-ETA recalculation**: Slot intervals seamlessly integrate with the rolling queue model, absorbing delays through configured hourly buffer slots.

## 🔒 Two-Factor Secure Appointment Tracking

Public tracking prevents enumeration attacks while maintaining zero-friction patient access:
1. **Identifier**: `Token` or `Appointment ID` (e.g. `DM-SRID-261017-1030`).
2. **Verification Barrier**: Requires matching the patient's registered mobile number (full 10 digits or last 4 digits) or unique tracking secret.
3. **Live Queue Radar**: Displays patients ahead, doctor delay in minutes, expected consultation time, and recommended arrival buffer (e.g., arrive 15 minutes ahead of expected time).

## 🔄 Database Migration Path: SQLite to PostgreSQL

During Phase 1 development, Doctormate uses **SQLite with WAL mode** for instant zero-dependency local execution. The schema is strictly designed for straightforward migration to PostgreSQL.

### Schema Equivalence Table

| SQLite Column Definition | PostgreSQL Equivalent | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id TEXT PRIMARY KEY` | `id VARCHAR(64) PRIMARY KEY` | Standard UUID / prefixed ID |
| `name TEXT NOT NULL` | `name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL` | Entity name |
| `slot_duration_minutes INTEGER` | `slot_duration_minutes INTEGER DEFAULT 15` | Doctor consultation duration |
| `booking_source TEXT` | `booking_source VARCHAR(32)` | `'PHONE'`, `'ONLINE'`, `'WALK_IN'` |
| `status TEXT` | `status VARCHAR(32)` | Queue and appointment state |
| `history_json TEXT` | `history_json JSONB` | Audit trail events |
| `created_at TEXT` | `created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()` | ISO timestamp |

### Steps to Switch to PostgreSQL in Production:
1. Set `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/doctormate` in `.env`.
2. Replace `better-sqlite3` driver calls in `server/db.ts` with `pg` (node-postgres) connection pool.
3. Run table DDL script (`server/postgres-schema.sql`).
4. Execute `npm run migrate:pg` to copy initial records from SQLite to PostgreSQL.
